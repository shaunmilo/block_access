# About this module
Very basic D8 version of block_access. Doesn't add all the permissions for the various tabs/visibility etc that block_access on D7 does.

# What it does
Adds permissions for editing block content - e.g 

- 'edit own|any {type} block content'
- 'delete own|any {type} block content'
- 'create {type} block content'

Please use the github issues to log any problems. Would like to get this back to drupal.org eventually.
